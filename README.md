## GroceryList

- Create a branch for your grocery list app.

- Set up a groceries database
- Add a table for `groceryitems` with the following columns
    - `name`
    - `quantity`

- Set up `pg-promise` to access this database

- Write queries to Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete items

- Use theses queries inside of functions

- Group these functions into their own node module.


## BlogBlogBlog

Similar to the GroceryList app, you'll create a database with the following tables:

- Posts
- Authors

You'll need to add foreign keys in your `create table` statements, and you'll want additional queries that use `inner join` to retrieve info from both tables.

### Bonus: add a Comments table



# Adding Users

# Adding Relationships

## Add an `edit` link to each `<li>`

Added this to the backtick string in `userToItem` (in the `userList.js` file).
